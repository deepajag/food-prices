# Investigating food environment disparities using digital supermarket transactions for fruits and vegetables in Quebec

This repository contains code for three papers published as part of a PhD Dissertation. The papers include:
1.Jahagirdar, D; Quesnel-Vallée, A, Ma, Y, Buckeridge, D. (2018) The dynamic between affordability and accessibility of healthy food. 
2.Jahagirdar, D; Quesnel-Vallée, A, Ma, Y, Buckeridge, D.(2018) Disparities in the availability and variety of fruits and vegetables. 
3.Jahagirdar, D; Quesnel-Vallée, A, Ma, Y, Buckeridge, D. (2018) Temporal and Seasonal Variation in the Affordability of Fruits and Vegetables. 

data_script.R contains the initial data structuring, after importing data from SQL. It also contains the code used to merge the business directory, census and marketing databases.
themes_functions.R contains functions and graphics themes used throughout.

The folders accessibility-affordability, affordability-temporal-variation, availability-variety each contain code for the descriptives and analysis in the papers. There are unfortunately dependencies on non-publically available data, so the code is meant to be indicative rather than enable others to reproduce the work exactly. However I am happy to provide further information or code for specific parts, by request.
